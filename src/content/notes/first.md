# First Post

Welcome!

This is a personal blog/note space, mainly for myself. I hope to use it to prompt me to write and take personal notes more often, and to hopefully build up into a personal web development portfolio site.

I'm currently 9-odd years deep into a career as a software Product Manager, but I'd like to further hone my software engineering skills. I'm largely self-taught, but I have plenty of real-world experience in the trenches of building software products and working programmatically with business data.

Goals:
* Write here semi-regularly.
* Build a portfolio of projects.
* Seriously consider a career shift into software engineering.
