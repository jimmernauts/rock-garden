## Impostor syndrome and too many choices

It seems really difficult to know who to trust or how to make good choices. I imagine that is just a feature of professional life in general, particularly when trying to switch careers, and not necessarily linked to software.

Some of the questions I am struggling to resolve are:

* Where/how should I specialize the code I am writing? Full stack vs frontend? I like the visual/UX focus of frontend, but maybe getting things working end-to-end is more important at this stage.
* Continue with Javascript/Typescript, or switch to something more "backend" flavoured like Python or Elixir? I think I probably don't want to go for the more 'enterprise-y' options like Java or C#, even though there are likely more jobs there. I have some small exposure to Python from data wrangling projects.
* On the frontend, continue with Web Components / fundamentals, or shift focus more to React? I think I have done enough playing with Solid/Preact for now that I have some basics here, but I imagine there is a lot still to learn on more 'enterprise' React-style like state management, BFFE style, etc.
* On the backend, should I go deeper into MVC? That seems like the way to go - should I pick a Node framework, or a new language? If so, Django or Elixir or Spring? I think I definitely want to focus more on the monolithic style of app architecture than microservices.
* How to learn? Should I continue just building my own toy projects/digital garden, or should I try and get more real-world application development experience? That sounds like a better way to go, but what is the path to get there?
* Paid learning resources? Should I buy tutorials? Enroll in a bootcamp? What about a more formal degree program?
* What about more "crunchy" SWE topics like Algorithms & Data Structures? How important is any of that at the moment? When does it become important?
* What about if/when I actually get a job as a software developer? How do I continue learning and getting better at the above? It seems like the industry paradigm is that you just work and it naturally happens. What are the areas where I should focus now to build a sustainable craft?

None of these are must-solve for me right now - or even have solutions - they're just observations.
