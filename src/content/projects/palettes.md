## Description

Photography is an occasional hobby that I enjoy, especially trying to pick out particularly nice landscapes or colorways that I stumble across. I'm incredibly lucky to live in a very beautiful part of the world, but I think photography also helps one find the beauty in the everyday.

Something I've dabbled with is pulling colors out of digital photos to create palettes for different projects, both on the web and IRL. There are plenty of existing tools to do this - the one I have used to some success is Adobe Color (https://color.adobe.com/mythemes).

There are a few things I think could be improved:
* I'd like to save the image along with the palette that I generate
* I'd like to zoom in on a section of the image, and blur or gradient the colors within it to end up with my selected color
* I'd like to experiment with color space and color functions

The main use case, that I would want to preserve, would be:
1. Upload a photo
2. Drag a color picker over the photo
3. The color picker zooms into and shows colors of individual pixels
4. Select a pixel I like to add to a palette
5. Save the palette

This would require quite a bit of L&D for me on the frontend to make this happen. Could be fun!
